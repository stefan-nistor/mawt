        <p>
            In this report we will describe the application functionality of creating a Web System for Managing Water Turbines, explain choices of implementation and general purposes for such an application.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The report aims to describe the uses of a web system for Managing Water Turbines, along with how did our team go about implementing such a web application.
        </p>
        <p>
            In today's time, many applications have a web interface, since it's easy to use for both clients and developers who need to find data about a specific topic. Unlike a desktop application for example, a web application is more easily customizable and managable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main audiance for this report are people who are interested in web applications for managing different types of real life systems, as well as people who are interested in the concrete applications of a System for Managing Water Turbines.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of this application is to assist in visualising, comparing and adding different water turbines around the world. The main benefit of such a web system is, of course, the user-friendliness that it provides for the specific tassk. Our objectives
            in developing this app are to help people interested in such a system have a better experience for managing and visualising Water Turbines.
        </p>

            <p>
                This web application can be used in any operation system (Windows, Mac, Linux) that supports one of the main web browsers (like Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge). Some design constraints will appear because of the different ways different browsers
                interpret HTML, CSS, JS but the general functionalities should be the same. The backend server is written in NodeJS, and the version requires to run it is ^8.15.1.

        <section id="person-org">
            <!-- review? -->
            <h3>User Interfaces</h3>
            <p>
                Our web application provides diffenet sub-pages for the user management system and the hydropower plant management system. For the user management system, there will be pages for choosing between signup/login, and pages for the sign up and log in systems.
                For the hydropower plant management system, there are: a page for getting information about the top 10 biggest capacity hydropower plants around the world, a page for getting the list of hydropower plants around the world, a page for querying
                for a specific hydropower plant and visialising details about it and a page for users to define their own hydropower plants. Also there are pages for the User functions (like change email, delete account, disconnect), an about page with
                generic trivia and a page which provides a RSS Feed.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="roles">
            <h3>Backend Interfaces</h3>
            <p>
                For the backend, we use an MVC model, models being for the users and hidroplants data, views being for the routes which are exposed to the frontend, and controllers being for implementation of the code which gets the data, parses it if needed, and sends
                the response back for a specific request.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="actions">
            <h3>Communication Interfaces</h3>
            <p>
                These interfaces will manage the communication between frontend and backend, managing different HTTP requests (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH etc.). Certain routes (all but Login, Regiser, Forgot-Password) are protected using JWT tokens, so the server
                can assure that the user is logged in. The server exposes the routes, and, from the frontend we make requests using `axios` in order to get the needed data.

        <h2>System Features</h2>
        <h3>User Management</h3>
        <p>
            This application will be able to manage users. Such users can sign in with a new account (username, password, email), in which case the system will add that account (with the password hashed) to the user table in the embedded database, and users can also
            log in with an existing account (requiring username or email and password to be valid), in which case the database will be queryed to find if such an account exists.
        </p>
        <h3>Biggest Water Turbines Visualization</h3>
        <p>
            The system will import data about Water Turbines around the world, and users that are logged in will be able to visualize the biggest water turbines existing in the database. Users will be able to see turbine's location, electric power generated, capacity,
            frequency of rotation, rated speed, average energy production and the turbines used with Fracis type 4 x 56,5 MW vertical axis.
        </p>
        <h3>Seach for a specific Turbine</h3>
        <p>
            Users will be able to search for a water turbine's name, and if it exists in the database, information about it (mentioned earlier) will be shown, along with it's status (in use, defective etc.), and a live page progress.
        </p>
        <h3>Templates for user-defined Water Turbines</h3>
        <p>
            Users are also be able to define their own template Water Turbines from My Hidroplant Page, feature which will help project the ideas and visialise how their defined hydropower plant will function, depending of the given specifications.
