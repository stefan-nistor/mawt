                        WHAT IS THE COST OF HYDROPOWER?

                    <div class="more-info">
                        Hydropower is an affordable source of electricity that costs less than most. 
                        Since hydropower relies only on the energy from moving water, states that get 
                        the majority of their electricity from hydropower, like Idaho, Washington, and 
                        Oregon, have lower energy bills than the rest of the country. <br>
                        <br>

                        Compared to other electricity sources, hydropower also has relatively low costs 
                        throughout the duration of a full project lifetime in terms of maintenance, 
                        operations, and fuel . Like any major energy source, significant upfront costs 
                        are unavoidable, but hydropower’s longer lifespan spreads these costs out over time. 
                        Additionally, the equipment used at hydropower facilities often operates for longer 
                        periods of time without needing replacements or repairs, saving money in the long 
                        term.<br><br>

                        The installation costs for large hydropower facilities consist mostly of civil 
                        construction works (such as the building of the dams, tunnels, and other necessary 
                        infrastructure) and electromechanical equipment costs (electricity-generating 
                        machinery). Since hydropower is a site-specific technology, these costs can be 
                        minimized at the planning stage through proper selection of location and design.

                        The <b>benefits of hydropower</b> have been recognized and harnessed for thousands of 
                        years. In addition to being a clean and cost-effective form of energy,
                         hydropower plants can provide power to the grid immediately, serving as a 
                         flexible and reliable form of backup power during major electricity outages 
                         or disruptions. Hydropower also produces a number of benefits outside of 
                         electricity generation, such as flood control, irrigation support, and water 
                         supply.

                        The <b>history of hydropower</b> dates back thousands of years. For example, the Greeks 
                        used water wheels to grind wheat into flour more than <a>2,000 years ago</a>. The evolution 
                        of the modern hydropower turbine began in the mid-1700s when a French hydraulic and 
                        military engineer, Bernard Forest de Bélidor, wrote Architecture Hydraulique. 
                        Many key developments in hydropower technology occurred during the first half of the 
                        19th century, and more recently, the past century has seen a number of hydroelectric 
                        advancements that have helped hydropower become an integral part of the renewable 
                        energy mix in the United States.
